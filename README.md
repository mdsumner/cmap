The goal of cmap is to provide colours from matplotlib.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cmap like so:

``` r
pak::pkg_install(file.path("mdsumner", "cmap"))
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(cmap)
pal <- cm_pal("gnuplot")
image(volcano, col = pal(100, alpha = 0.5))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-example-1.png" width="100%" />

``` r

par(mfrow = n2mfrow(4))
for (i in 1:4) {
image(volcano, col = cm_pal(nm <- sample(cm_names(), 1))(64), main = nm)
}
```

<img src="man/figures/README-example-2.png" width="100%" />

You can also use the cm object itself, but we havenâ€™t thought about that
much yet.

``` r
cmap:::cm$brg(seq(0, 1,length.out = 5))
#>           [,1]        [,2]      [,3] [,4]
#> [1,] 0.0000000 0.000000000 1.0000000    1
#> [2,] 0.5019608 0.000000000 0.4980392    1
#> [3,] 0.9960784 0.003921569 0.0000000    1
#> [4,] 0.4941176 0.505882353 0.0000000    1
#> [5,] 0.0000000 1.000000000 0.0000000    1
```
