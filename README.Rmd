# cmap

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of cmap is to provide colours from matplotlib. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of cmap like so:

``` r
pak::pkg_install(file.path("hypertidy", "cmap"))
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(cmap)
pal <- cm_pal("gnuplot")
image(volcano, col = pal(100, alpha = 0.5))

par(mfrow = n2mfrow(4))
for (i in 1:4) {
image(volcano, col = cm_pal(nm <- sample(cm_names(), 1))(64), main = nm)
}

```
